Migration, Specialization, and Trade: Evidence from the Brazilian March
 to the West
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Thailand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are regressions of migration flows on previous stock of workers for
 Thailand, using census 1970 and 1980.
 The geographical unit are provinces.
 Crops on these census are sufficiently disaggregated to do the analysis.
 We keep data on people that are farmers that work on the following crops:
 rice, corn, rubber, cassava, coconut, wood, fish, and hunting.
 For migration from origin to destination province, the notion of origin
 that we use is the province where the person was born.
 As in the original paper, we exclude cases where the origin province are
 equal to the destination province in the regressions.

Thailand, balance check between 1970 and 1980 census
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 1970 census had a sample of 2% for a total of 772169 people, where district
 was the smallest geography in the sampling design.
 The 1980 census had a sample of 1% for a total of 388141 people, where
 provinces were in this case the smallest geography in the sampling design.
 In the ocassions where there is production of a crop in both census, the
 number are sufficiently close such that they could reflect structural change
 and not errors of some kind.
 There are ocassions where the production of some crop in some province
 disappears in or the production of a new crop appears in 1980, but in the
 majority of cases production of a crop happens in both census.

\begin_layout Subsection
Thailand, regressions with migration flows at the person level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still working on this, but I've been thinking expanding the datasets according
 to the person weights and then run probit regressions since we assume that
 the error terms in the transmission of knowledge regression distributes
 lognormal.
 Regarding the first point, that is, if a row has a person weight of 38,
 which means that that observation represents 38 people in ZA, then I repeat
 that row 38 times.
 This will yield millions of observations.
 Regarding the second point, this would be a probit regression where the
 dependent variable is the dummy variable 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{wijkt}$
\end_inset

, which equals 1 when the person 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 lives in region 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, was born in region 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, grows crop 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, 0 otherwise.
 Given that in the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $log(u^{migration})$
\end_inset

 distributes normal, then the probability that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{wijkt}=1$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi(\iota_{jkt}+\iota_{ijt}+\kappa\beta logL_{ijkt-1})$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
South Africa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the regressions for the 2007 census of South Africa.
 Location is at the province level, there are 9 provinces.
 There are 18 crops: grain and staple farming, vegetable farming, nursery
 farming, fruit farming, vineyards, sugar cane, cotton, cattle, chicken,
 horse, dairy, sheep, ostrich, goat, ocean fishing, inland fishing, fish
 farms, and mixed farming.
 For the regressions of wages of migrant farmers on 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{ikt-1}$
\end_inset

, we calculate average earnings by origin-destination-crop.
 The origin variable is determined by which province the person was born.

\begin_layout Section
Brazil
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are regressions of migration flows and earnings on previous stock
 of workers for Brazil.
 Dependent variables are from census 2000 and 2010, and the main covariate
 is lagged by thirty years, so it is derived from censuses 1970 and 1980.
 For both migration flows 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{ijkt}$
\end_inset

 and earnings 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ijkt}$
\end_inset

, origin is the state where the person was born, and destination is the
 mesoregion the person resides at the time of the census.
 We consider 13 crops: banana, cassava, chicken, cocoa, coffee, cotton,
 corn, fish, livestock, rice, soy, sugarcane, and tobacco.
 In contrast to the original paper, we exclude fruits and horticulture since
 it is unclear how to code this from IPUMS's categorization.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regs_BR"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 present results for both OLS and PPML regressions.
 Results are very similar to those in the original paper, but higher values.
 This might be due to many reasons, including these regressions not including
 other covariates, the location variable not being as granular (in the original
 paper, origin and destination are both at the mesoregion), not including
 fruits and horticulture, our sample of migrants being comprised by 30-65
 year old head of households, etc.

Summary Statistics

\begin_layout Paragraph
Income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use person's total monthly income from their labor.
 Amounts are expressed as they were reported at the time of the census in
 the currency of the respective country.
 They are not adjusted for inflation or devaluation.
 Specifically relating to the Brazilian data: All Brazilian figures are
 monthly incomes.
 Brazilian currency changed considerably over time.
 The cruzeiro was devalued at 1000 to 1 in 1967.
 The cruzado, equal to 1000 cruzeiros, was introduced in 1986.
 In 1989 the cruzado was devalued, with 1 new cruzado = 1000 old cruzados.
 In March 1990, the cruzeiro replaced the cruzado, with no change in value.
 In 1993, the cruzeiro reais replaced the cruzeiro, with 1 cruzeiro reias
 = 1000 cruzeiros.
 Finally, in 1994 the currency was changed to the real, where 1 real = 2750
 cruzeiros reais.
 For our purposes, we only use income data for 2000 and 2010, so units are
 consistent across censuses.
 In Figure XX we show the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta w_{ijk2010}=w_{ijk2010}-w_{ijk2000}$
\end_inset

.
 There are 44252 potential cells, 42060 missing values so 2192 positive
 values.
 Only 19 cells report a value of zero, so it is not a major issue.
 The distribution exhibit two very long tails, with the right tail being
 slightly larger.
 When we zoom in, we see that the distribution is slightly skewed to the
 left, so in general wages increase.

\begin_layout Standard
We see how

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{kt}$
\end_inset

 evolve over time.
 Units are weighted number of people, so we can go all the way back to 1970
 whenever possible.
 In Figure XX we see 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{jt}$
\end_inset

 over time normalized at 1970.
 Expected behavior no weird jumps.
 In Figure XX we see 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{kt}$
\end_inset

 over time from 1970 to 2010 excluding cassava, corn, and soy since they
 were not produced in 1970 and 1980.
 There are more people working in producing bananas, chicken, fish, and
 livestock in 2010 than in 1970.
 For the rest of crops, there are less people working on these crops.
 In Figure XX we see 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{kt}$
\end_inset

 over time from 1991 to 2010 including cassava, corn, and soy.
 There are only more people working in producing fish and chicken in 2010
 with respect to 1991.
 This probably reflects structural change.

Migration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our purposes, we only use migration data for 2000 and 2010.
 In Figure XX we show the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta L_{ijk2010}=L_{ijk2010}-L_{ijk2000}$
\end_inset

.
 There are 44252 potential cells, 39570 cells where there is no change in
 migration patterns, so 4955 cells exhibit changes in migration patterns.
 The distribution has a huge spike at 0.
 If we remove these zeroes, we see that the distribution is slightly skewed
 to the left.
 If we zoom in, we confirm that people have been migrating out of many places,
 probably to migrate to a few places such as Minas Gerais, and probably
 to produce main products.
